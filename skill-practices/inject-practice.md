## Inject Response Example

To: Acme Corp <br>
From: Team 99 <br>
Date: 1 January 1970 <br>
Subject: ABE-010 Analyze a Business Email <br>

Upon investigating the given email, Team 99 concludes that the email is not legitimate and is instead phishing. The list below details several email characteristics present in the email and why each characteristic indicates that the email is phishing.

* **Sender Address**: The email sender address \<administraciones[@]pentagon-securidad.cl\> is not a valid email domain associated with American Express.

* **Professionalism**: The email content is filled with many grammatical and formatting errors which indicates that the email did not actually originate from the purported company. 

* **Email Tone**: The tone of the email urges the user to take a specific action quickly, which is a common trick used by phishers.

* **Addressed Recipient**: The email address isn't personally addressed to the CIO; most communications from a company address their recipients by name.

Although this singular phishing email was caught, the organization should perform the following steps in order to establish a successful phishing process to catch all phishing emails:

1. **Phishing Mailbox**: Create a mailbox to which employees can forward their phishing emails for review.
2. **Sandbox**: Create a sandbox environment in which the security staff can test files and links discovered in phishing emails without harming the normal system network.
3. **Email Filtering**: Utilize an email filtering software that scans emails to block known phishing attempts before delivery to a user's inbox.
4. **Security Training**: Regularly train employees on how to spot phishing emails and how to report phishing emails to security staff.

These solutions will help strengthen the internal security of the organization. Please reach out if you have further questions.

Best, <br>
Team 99
